# bash-scripts

In this I leanrnt how to do basic bash scripts and learnt the basics of how to use if cond to make a mini game.
Also leant how to use a curl command to get get the weather.
Bash scripting is a key skill in order to automate different parts if your day.
Something that I did specificlly that helped me automate my day is when I do tryhackme, I use openvpn to connect to the THM servers to be able to use there virtual machines to do the multiple differnt CTFs and usage of tools on their network. 
It takes a lot of work to type it all out correctly so I made a bash script with the command to just run the one command and open a new terminal on the side. 
I am still developing my skills in bash scripting and have a lot to learn. I have recently learnt about regular expressions and the potential usage of it in bashscripts and cybersecurity and using grep specifically.
