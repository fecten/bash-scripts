# bash-scripts

In this project/learning assignment I will learn bash script by making a simple game.
As well as use bash scripts to optimize parts of my day and I will show and demonstrate that in the scripts.
I will be adding more to this as I learn more skills in bash scripting and the multitude of different ways of using it.
