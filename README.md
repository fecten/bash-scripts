# bash-scripts

In this scripting project I leanrnt how to do basic bash scripts and learnt the basics of how to use if conditions to make a mini game.
Also leant how to use a curl command to get get the weather.
Bash scripting is a key skill in order to automate different parts of your day.
Something that I did specificlly that helped me automate my day is when I do tryhackme, I use openvpn to connect to the THM servers to be able to use there virtual machines to do multiple differnt CTFs and usage of tools on their network. 
It takes a lot of time to type it all out correctly so I made a bash script with the specific command to just run the one command and open a new terminal on the side as it runs a config file that controls the connection to the THM server. 
I am still developing my skills in bash scripting and have a lot to learn. I have recently learnt about regular expressions and the potential usage of it in bashscripts and cybersecurity and using grep specifically. I plan on commiting my basic bash scripts
then as I learn more I will commit more on to this area.
I also will be deleting this account but I will be using it too learn as much as I can as I need to update my github more often! So over this reading week I will make my new git account and make a bunch of commits. At least 1 every day.
